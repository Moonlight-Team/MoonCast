# MoonCast Engine

#### A 2D and 3D Sonic physics engine for Godot 4, aiming to be modular, robust, and easy to use.

#### DISCLAIMER: THIS SOFTWARE IS IN A PRE-RELEASE STATE AND IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIALLY LARGE AND BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY BREAKING CHANGES DURING DEVELOPMENT

## Features:
* 3D and 2D character support.
* Tight and complementary integration into Godot's physics engine and other systems.
* Custom Resource types that can be used for both the 3D and 2D systems.
* Easy to use script API for adding and extending player abilities in a modular way.
* Highly configurable player node types.
* Simple player Node setup without any scene inheritance or hard-coded Node paths.

## Overview:

MoonCast uses physics tables, in the form of a custom Resource class called `MoonCastPhysicsTable`. This one physics table is used by both the 2D and 3D player characters. Coupled with the 3D and 2D physics being intentionally similarly designed, this allows for seamless matching physics controlling between 2D and 3D. 

The player character classes, `MoonCastPlayer2D` and `MoonCastPlayer3D`, are the custom `CharacterBody`-based classes with which characters are built. On their own, they contain the code for:
* Momentum-based movement (including slope calculations)
* Rolling
* Jumping
* Playing sound effects
* Triggering animations (through MoonCast's own `MoonCastAnimation` system). 

**Intentionally, no other abilities, including spindashing, super forms, the drop dash, etc, are included in these base `MoonCastPlayer` classes.**

For those, MoonCast has its `MoonCastAbility` system. Inheriting instances of this `Node`-based class are added as children of a `MoonCastPlayer2D`/`MoonCastPlayer3D` node. This class provides several virtual function overrides called during various events in the physics processes of the characters, while still having the access to the full scope of Godot Engine, allowing for near infinite and easy to configure runtime code additions to the character to which they are children of. 

Additionally, MoonCast also implements its own `MoonCastAnimation` resource used as a wrapper for all animations in the engine. This wrapper includes parameters for animation playback speed, customizing rotation parameters, and defining a custom collision shape that will be active during the animation, as well as other extendability options.

## Using MoonCast In Your Projects:

To add MoonCast to your project, simply copy the `MoonCast/` folder the root of your Godot 4.4+ project. 

Most information pertaining to specifics of the engine, such as the use of variables or functions, can be viewed within the Godot editor, via the in-engine (Class Reference) docs.

Furthermore, in `addons/`, there is a Godot editor plugin that adds a `MoonCast Docs` main screen to your editor, which contains supplementary information about things not described in the Godot Class Reference documentation, such as more detailed explanations of MoonCast's systems, and how to perform basic setup of player nodes. This plugin is entirely optional and can be removed or disabled if not needed, and you do *not* need this plugin to have the documentation that shows up natively in Godot's documentation system.

#### Reminder: MoonCast is licensed under MIT, so please do not forget to credit its usage in your project. 

## The MoonCast Demo:

In this repository, under the `Demo/` folder, is a demo for MoonCast, demonstrating a basic 2D and basic 3D utilization of the engine. Also in this repo is a `Framework/` folder, which has a lot of extra files that will be useful for those looking for "framework-like" things, like pre-made objects. __*Nothing in the framework or demo is required for MoonCast Engine to function, and is merely provided for example and convenience.*__

The scripts/code of the demo are licensed under the same license as MoonCast Engine (MIT), and require no further crediting then that of MoonCast itself. 

The sprites, tiles, audio, etc. of the demo are **NOT** licensed under the same license as the code. Please refrain from using those in your project without getting explicit prior permission from the Moonlight Team.

The one exception is the splash video found in `video/`, which can be used as an option for crediting MoonCast.
